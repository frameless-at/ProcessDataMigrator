RockPageBuilder is a Fieldtype/Inputfield module that helps you creating modular content for your project.

## Setup

- Install RockMigrations and RockFrontend
- Install RockPageBuilder
- RockPageBuilder will automatically add the `Widgets` and `Content-Elements` field to your home template
- Add your first block (see section below)
- Render the field on the frontend (see section below)

### Creating New Blocks

To create a new block simply click on the plus icon in the field that you want to add a new block to:

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/4e8ScVs.png height=300>

Enter a name and submit the form - RockPageBuilder will automatically create all the necessary files in the background!

#### Block Settings

You can define several block settings in the block's PHP file:

```php
<?php

namespace RockPageBuilderBlock;

use RockPageBuilder\Block;

class Demo extends Block
{

  const prefix = "rpb_demo_";

  public function info()
  {
    return [
      'title' => 'Demo-Title',
      'color' => 'lime',
      'icon' => 'picture-o',
      'description' => 'RockPageBuilder Block Setup Demo',
      // 'hideTitle' => true, // shortcut to set title field to hidden
    ];
  }
}
```

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/2iBm6nd.png height=200>

You can either set a fontawesome icon name (like `check`, `user-o` [etc]) or you can create your own block-preview-mockups or just make a screenshot of your rendered block and use that as a preview by adding the image as `YourBlockName.svg/png/jpg`:

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/xorsOjm.png height=100>

In this case the logo-image path is `/site/assets/RockPageBuilder/blocks/Demo/Demo.svg`.

### Rendering RockPageBuilder on the Frontend

Rendering the default "blocks" field is as simple as adding this line to your frontend:

```php
// site/templates/home.php
<div id="content">
	Homepage content
	<?= $rockpagebuilder->render() ?>
</div>
```

You can create as many RockPageBuilder fields as you want. If you added a RPB field called `foo` you can render it like this:

```php
echo $page->foo->render();
```

By default RockPageBuilder will render a "plus" icon on empty fields. If you don't want that you can provice `false` as render parameter:

```php
echo $rockpagebuilder->render(false);
echo $page->foo->render(false);
```

## ProcessWire Version

RockPageBuilder requires PW 3.0.211 or higher. This is the latest master version (3.0.210) with one additional commit that fixes a problem with the core implementation of repeaters.

Here is the mentioned commit: https://github.com/processwire/processwire/commit/b12c7e903101ba595029ad2fa9e1ed0f8d01f669

And here is the download link of that version of ProcessWire: https://github.com/processwire/processwire/archive/b12c7e903101ba595029ad2fa9e1ed0f8d01f669.zip

I've been using the latest DEV version for years now and can't remember of any problems, so in my opinion there's no need to stick with the master version.

## Goals

The goals of this module are

- Make it easy for the client to create custom section-based pages
- Make it easy, fast and fun to develop blocks
- Make it possible to reuse blocks across projects by simply copying all block-files

## Limitations/issues

- works only with AdminThemeUikit!
- The module should work with all common fields out of the box. If you find any field that is not fully supported, please let me know and I'll add support for it as it should be quite easy for really any field I can think of.
- Seems that showIf does not work with RockPageBuilder? MPN AnchorHeadline

## Roadmap

-- v1 --

- Hide/unpublish blocks
- GUI to edit multiple hidden blocks on the frontend (eg anchor + colorblock)
- caching?

-- v2 --

- undo/restore feature
- copy blocks to other pages

## Magic field methods

You can access every field of your blocks via short method calls. So if you had a field called `rockpagebuilder_textblock_foo` you could access that field via `$page->foo()`.

That will not only display the value of the field but will also make it editable on the frontend and if you are using RockFrontend + LATTE it will return an HTML object so that you don't need to apply the `|noescape` filter!

Note: The magic method call will always use the fraction of the fieldname that comes after the last underscore:

```
my_foo_field --> field()
my_bar_field --> field()
what_so_ever --> ever()
```

Obviously that would collide for `my_foo_field` and `my_bar_field`. In that case just access your fields the regular PW way or rename your fields to `my_foofield` and `my_barfield`.

### Magic field value return types

By default (with no argument) the `$page->foo()` call will return the editable field. There are two more options:

- `$page->foo(1)` will return the raw formatted value
- `$page->foo(2)` will return the raw unformatted value
- `$page->foo(3)` will return the raw unformatted value as nette html object

## Block Labels

```php
public function getLabel() {
  return $this->body;
}
```

Label with custom HTML:

```php
public function getLabel() {
  return $this->html("<strong>MyBlock:</strong> {$this->title}");
}
```

## YAML recorder

You can make RockPageBuilder save a yaml configuration of your block's field and template settings like this:

```php
class ExampleBlock extends Block
{
  public function info()
  {
    return [
      'title' => 'IconColumns',
      'yaml' => true,
    ];
  }
}
```

### Migrations

You can use migrations additionally to the YAML recorder:

```php
public function migrateBeforeYaml() {
  // this code will run BEFORE yaml settings have been applied
  // that means settings from the yaml file will overwrite settings from here
}
public function migrateAfterYaml() {
  // this code will run AFTER yaml settings have been applied
  // that means settings from here will overwrite settings from the yaml file
}
```

## Translations

When working with frontend template engines like latte one drawback is that you can't use ProcessWire's built in transation functions like `__('your translatable string')`. That's because ProcessWire will only look for such stings in PHP files and also latte has problems understanding those function calls. Since every block has a PHP file we can simply put all translatable strings into that file and access them from the latte file via the `$block->x()` helper function:

```php
<?php namespace RockPageBuilderBlock;
use RockPageBuilder\Block;
class Demo extends Block {

  public function info() {
    return [
      'icon' => 'check',
      'title' => 'demo block',
      'x' => [
        'my_foo_string' => $this->_('I am the translatable foo string'),
        'my_bar_string' => $this->_('I am the translatable bar string'),

        // this syntax will need the following line before the class statement
        // use function ProcessWire\__;
        'my_bar_string' => __('I am the translatable bar string'),
      ],
    ];
  }
}
```

And in your template file:

```html
<div style="padding: 50px; border: 2px solid blue;">
  <h1>{$block->x('my_foo_string')}</h1>
  <p>{$block->x('my_bar_string')}</p>
</div>
```

----------------- everything below is partly outdated!! ------------------------

## Concept

The most important part are so called `blocks` that are actually ProcessWire pages with a corresponding `template` and a custom `pageClass`.

RockPageBuilder ships with some example blocks that you can use to quickly get started with RockPageBuilder:

```php
// site/init.php (or in module init())
if($modules->isInstalled('RockPageBuilder')) {
  $mx = $modules->get('RockPageBuilder');
  $mx->addBlocks($config->paths->siteModules."RockPageBuilder/demo/");
}
```

## Benefits using RockPageBuilder

Benefits for users

- You will get a lot more flexibility for your page layouts
- You will get a lot cleaner user interfaces with less other plugins or workarounds, eg: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6616448/178727428-c4c72906-ad57-45cf-ac82-49320edb3b99.png
- You will get meaningfol labels of your content blocks (compared to only showing the type of the block)

Technical benefits (compared to other solutions and workarounds)

- You will get cleaner code (OOP)
- Since all blocks are ProcessWire Pages under the hood they are super easy to handle via API or via RockMigrations

## RockPageBuilder vs. RepeaterMatrix

Like RepeaterMatrix RockPageBuilder extends the core Repeater Fieldtype, but the concept is very different. As mentioned above every block of a RockPageBuilder is a custom Page (that's the same with RepeaterMatrix) having a custom template (that's not the case with RepeaterMatrix) and also having a custom PageClass (that's also not the case with RepeaterMatrix). RepeaterMatrix on the other hand creates ONE template for all your rpb blocks and then hides or shows the fields that you have defined via the admin interface. That means RepeaterMatrix creates less templates but on the code side you'll end up with ONE page type for MANY block types.

That means that you need to use hooks to customize your pages which has many disadvantages in my opinion. RockPageBuilder on the other hand creates a custom page type for every block type which makes it super convenient to code:

```php
class BlockFoo extends Block {
  public function foo() {
    return 'foo';
  }
}
class BlockBar extends Block {
  public function bar() {
    return 'bar';
  }
}
// vs
$wire->addHookMethod('RepeaterBlockPage::foo', function($event) {
  $page = $event->object;
  if($page->type !== 'rpbTypeFoo') return;
  $event->return = 'foo';
});
$wire->addHookMethod('RepeaterBlockPage::bar', function($event) {
  $page = $event->object;
  if($page->type !== 'rpbTypeBar') return;
  $event->return = 'bar';
});
```

Another difference is that every Block in RockPageBuilder comes with several helper methods that are handy for customizing the output on your frontend. For example you can add classes on every first rpb item or you can style even blocks differently than odd items (for example to swap images from left to right).

```php
if($block->isEven()) echo "<h1 class='uk-text-right'><?= $block->title ?></h1>";
else echo "<h1><?= $block->title ?></h1>";
```

Some available methods are:

- $block->isEven()
- $block->isOdd()
- $block->isFirstBlock()
- $block->isLastBlock()
- $block->isLastBlock()
- $block->isEvenType()

Note that isEvenType checks if the item has an odd index but only counts blocks of the same type that are in a row and not interrupted by a block of another type, eg:

```
A
B
C
C -> true
C
A
B
B -> true
```

### Getting field values on the Frontend

When creating blocks you usually add a bunch of fields. And when working on the frontend you'll likely output those fields. If you stick to the naming convention using class constants for fields named `Block::field_yourfield` then you can request your fields simply by invoking `yourfield()`:

```php
echo $block->yourfield();
```

This will not only output the content of your field but will also take care of converting it into a Latte HTML object so you don't have to |noescape the output! Wait... wouldn't that open doors for people adding HTML into their inputfields? No, because PW already returns the value of the input encoded. Nice!

Another great thing is that this will automatically make all instances of InputfieldText frontend editable! I love it :)

And what if you needed a custom return value for your `yourfield` value? Simply implement the `yourfield()` method in your block's PHP file and that will bypass all the magic and you'll have full control!

## Migrations (outdated!!)

RockPageBuilder relies havily on RockMigrations. Migrations are triggered automatically via RockPageBuilder.module.php on modules::refresh.

## Setting up new Blocks

**Update**: It is now easier to define blocks for one field:

```php
$mx->loadBlocks("fieldname", $path, "FooNamespace");
```

Blocks need to extend `\RockPageBuilder\Block`. To avoid naming conflicts you can use custom namespaces. See the demo folder in this module for examples. The minimum viable block is this:

```php
<?php namespace RockPageBuilderBlock;
class MinimumDemo extends \RockPageBuilder\Block {
}
```

Make sure you save the file as `MinimumDemo.php` and tell RockPageBuilder about that file (if it is not in an already monitored folder). Use `$mx->addBlocks('/your/dir')` as shown above.

### Block info

You can define several important settings for every block in the `infot()` method of the block.

```php
  public function info() {
    return [
      'icon' => 'bullhorn',
      'title' => 'Jobs',
      'color' => 'PaleGreen',
      'sort' => 900,
      'show' => function($page) {
        // show the button to add this block only on page having title 'Jobs'
        return $page->title == 'Jobs';
      },
    ];
  }
```

### Block settings

You can easily define settings for every block. While you could also use regular fields for block settings this method is a lot more efficient and streamlined. The feature uses RockFields for creating the fields. That means fields defined for block settings are runtime fields and don't exist in the database (so you'll also not find them in the fields editor). Also those fields are wrapped in a single Inputfield at the bottom of every block so they will save a lot of unused screen space compared to regular PW fields.

Another benefit is that you can define global settings for your project and then hide or add other settings only for some blocks.

#### Setting block settings via API

To add settings to your block simply install the RockFields module and add a method `settingsTable` to your block:

```php
// add this to your block's php file
public function settingsTable(RockFieldsField $field) {
  $settings = $this->getDefaultSettings($field);
  $settings->add([
    'name' => 'blockpadding',
    'label' => 'Block-Padding',
    'value' => $field->input('blockpadding', 'radios', [
      '*s' => 'small padding',
      'm' => 'medium padding',
      'l' => 'large padding',
    ]),
  ]);
  return $settings;
}
```

Often you want to define global settings for all blocks and extend those settings on some blocks:

```php
// in site/ready.php
/** @var RockPageBuilder $rpb */
$rpb = $this->wire->modules->get('RockPageBuilder');
$rpb->defaultSettings(
  function (BlockSettingsArray $settings, RockFieldsField $field, Block $block) {
    $settings->add([
      'name' => 'bgmuted',
      'label' => 'Add muted background',
      'value' => $field->input('bgmuted', 'checkbox'),
    ]);

    if($block->template == 'fooblock') {
      $settings->add(...);
    }
  }
);
```

Instead of if/else in the default settings callback you can also remove default settings in a specific block:

```php
// add this to your block's php file
public function settingsTable(RockFieldsField $field) {
  $settings = $this->getDefaultSettings();

  // hide one of the global settings
  $settings->remove('name=foo');
  // add a custom setting to this block
  $settings->add([
    'name' => 'bar',
    'label' => 'BAR-setting',
    'value' => $field->input('bar', 'select', [...]),
  ]);
  // you can also add settings on top:
  $settings->prepend([
    'name' => 'baz',
    'label' => 'BAZ-setting',
    'value' => $field->input('baz', 'select', [...]),
  ]);
  return $settings;
}
```

#### Block Settings Options

You can set options for the settings wrapper field in the info() method of your block:

```php
public function info() {
  return [
    ...
    'settings' => false, // no settings field for this block

    'settings' => [
      'label' => 'Settings for this block',
      'icon' => 'check',
      'collapsed' => Inputfield::collapsedNo,
    ],
  ];
}
```

#### The old way of doing it (for better understanding)

```php
public function settingsInput(RockFieldsField $field) {
  return $field->table([
    'Headline' => $field->input("headline"),
    'Whatever' => $field->input("whatever"),
  ]);
}
public function settingsSleep(RockFieldsField $field) {
  return [
    $field->getInputArray("headline"),
    $field->getInputArray("whatever"),
  ];
}
```

If settingsInput returns a string it will be used as value of a markup field. If you provide an array, it will be used as inputfield where you can define label, icon, collapsed state etc:

```php
public function settingsInput(RockFieldsField $field) {
  return [
    'label' => 'My Settings field',
    'icon' => 'check',
    'value' => $field->table([
      'Headline' => $field->input("headline"),
      'Whatever' => $field->input("whatever"),
    ]),
    'collapsed' => Inputfield::collapsedNo,
  ];
}
```

You have several options to access these settins on the frontend:

```php
// in your block's view file you can access settings via the $settings variable:
if($settins->mySetting == 'foo') echo 'Foo setting is set!';

// get a single setting and set a default value
$mySetting = $block->settings('mySetting', 'default value');

// same as above but different syntax
$mySetting = $settings->mySetting ?: 'default value';
```

## Render content

The content of the field can be rendered via the `render()` method of the field data object. This calls the `render()` method of each block. If you just `echo` the field value it will show the ids of the pagearray (which is the string representation of the pagearray and is necessary for usage on selectors).

### Render blocks

The markup for rendering your block can either be defined as `render()` method of your block or you can create a view file for your block e.g. `/site/assets/blocks/Slider.view.php`.

You can also use the `latte` templating engine by Nette, see https://latte.nette.org/en/syntax

This is an example `Image.latte` file:

```html
{if $settings->float}
<img
  data-src="{$block->src()}"
  alt="{$block->alt()}"
  uk-img
  class="uk-float-{$settings->align}"
/>
{else}
<section
  class="rpb-image uk-padding uk-text-{$settings->align}"
  uk-lightbox
>
  <a
    href="{$block->src(1600,1600)}"
    data-caption="{$block->alt()}"
    n:tag-if="$settings->lightbox"
  >
    <img
      data-src="{$block->src()}"
      alt="{$block->alt()}"
      uk-img
    />
  </a>
</section>
{/if}
```

## Field setup

Now create a new field and add it to a template. Allowed blocks are defined via hook:

```php
$wire->addHookAfter('RockPageBuilder::getAllowedBlocks', function($event) {
  $field = $event->arguments(0);
  $page = $event->arguments(1);
  if($field->name !== 'rmtest') return;
  $event->return->add([
    'RMDemo\Headline',
    'RMDemo\Markup',
  ]);
});
```

If you don't define a parent for blocks, the blocks will live under the default blocks datapage.

### Custom Parent

RockPageBuilder Blocks are a special kind of ProcessWire Pages, but they can just be regular pages with a custom URL endpoint as well!

First you need to define which parent to use in the block's php file:

```php
public function getParent($field, $page)
{
  // use the page where the block is created as parent
  // that means new blocks will be added as child of the page
  return $page->getBlockPage();
}
```

Then add a template file for your block. You can either create that file manually or use RockMigrations for it:

```php
// in the block's migrate() method:
$rm->createViewFile($this);
```

Now you should be able to click on "view" in your block's page editor. If you see an empty page you might need to manually include the `appendTemplateFile`:

```php
include '_main.php';
```

## Working with field data

The unformatted value of a RockPageBuilder field is a `RockPageBuilder\FieldData` object. This class is based on a `PageArray` and holds all blocks that are saved on that field.

The formatValue of the field is the result of the `render()` method call on the `FieldData` object and concats the results of all blocks' `render()` methods.

### Adding blocks to the field

Adding existing pages to the field is easy:

```php
$page->getUnformatted('your_rpb_field')
  ->add(1035) // add block id 1035 to this field
  ->save();
```

You can also add new blocks to your field data:

```php
$field = $page->getUnformatted('your_rpb_field');
$field->add('your-block-tpl', [
  // you can prepopulate fields of the block
  'headline' => 'This is a headline',
  'body' => '<p>Lorem Ipsum</p>',
);
$field->save();
```

Sometimes it's helpful to reset the field before adding new blocks:

```php
$page->rmtest->reset()->create(...)->create(...)->save();
```

## Example migration

```php
$rm->migrate([
  'fields' => [
    'your_field' => [
      'type' => 'FieldtypeRockPageBuilder',
      'tags' => self::tags,
    ],
  ],
])
```

## Content-Only fields

Quite often rpb blocks do only have one single field which has the same label as the block. As this would be redundant information and eat up quite some space on the screen RockPageBuilder has a shortcut to easily hide the label of such fields and reduce the field's padding:

```php
$rm->migrate([
  'fields' => [
    self::field_body => [
      'type' => 'textarea',
      'rpb-nolabel' => true,
      ...
```

## Widget Concept

### Selecting widgets from other pages

### Rendering widgets from template files

Sometimes you want to create a widget that the user can edit in the backend, but you as a developer want to define where the widget gets rendered. For example you could create a global `Team` widget that you want to render on all `job` pages. In the job's page template file you can render this widget like this:

```php
// either via widget name:
echo $rockpagebuilder->widgets('Team')->render();

// or you can also render any block like this
// where 123 is the block id
echo $pages->get(123)->renderBlock();
```

When editing the widget, it will show a warning on which pages the widget will be displayed. RockPageBuilder can not know about the code you added to the template file, therefore you need to tell RockPageBuilder about it:

```php
// in the widget's init() method
// in our example this is in Team.php (the php file of the Team widget)
$this->addHookAfter("RockPageBuilder::getWidgetPages", function($event) {
  $pages = $event->return;
  $pages->add($this->wire->pages->find("template=job"));
  $event->return = $pages;
});
```

## Block Spacings / Vertical Spacings (spaceV)

Static:

```php
'spaceV' => "50pxrem, 100pxrem",
'spaceID' => "white",
```

Dynamic:

```php
public function spaceID() {
  return $this->colorClass();
}
```

Remove margin from first and last element:

```php
<section ...>
  <div class="rpb-nomargin">
    <h1>Foo bar</h1>
    <p>Baz</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

## Overlay Feature

You can add an image of your design as overlay to your website. First enable the feature in your config.php

```php
$config->overlays = true;
```

Then render your overlay where you want it to be placed:

```php
// this will render /site/templates/overlays/home.png on the home template
echo $rockpagebuilder->overlay($page->template);
```

Then add your design image in `/site/templates/overlays` and RockPageBuilder will show the preview image as 50% overlay with a nice opacity slider.
